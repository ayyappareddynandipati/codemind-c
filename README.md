# 📘 Codemind-C Programs

Welcome to the **Codemind-C** repository!  
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of beginner to intermediate-level C programs that I learned and practiced during my **1.1 Semester** as part of my foundational programming journey.

Each `.c` file in this repo demonstrates essential concepts in C programming, ranging from arithmetic operations to logical decision-making, loops, arrays, functions, and pattern printing.
